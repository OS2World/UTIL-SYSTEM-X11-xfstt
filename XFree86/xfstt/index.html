<font size=+1>A port of Herbert Duerr's excellent xfstt to OS/2</font></center>
<p>xfstt lets you use TrueType fonts with the X windows system. TrueType fonts
look much nicer than most other popular scalable fonts at low resolution. In
addition, Windows (3.1, 3.11, 95, 98, and NT) uses TrueType fonts, so there are
lots of TrueType fonts easily available. <p>xfsttos2 is a port of xfstt to
OS/2. It lets you use TrueType fonts with the X windows system in OS/2,
including <a href="http://set.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86os2.html">XFree86 for
OS/2</a>. <p>If you want to use TrueType fonts with OS/2 Presentation Manager
and the Workplace Shell, please use the <a
href="http://www.freetype.org/ft_os2/index.html">FreeType/2</a> package, which
is also an excellent TrueType package. You can, of course, use xfsttos2 with
TrueType/2, and share fonts among xfsttos2, TrueType/2, and Win-OS/2 (or
Windows). <p>xfsttos2 is available for download <a
href="http://iiinet.ml.org/xfsttos2/xfsttos2.zip">here</a>. It is an entirely
opensource free software package licensed under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU Library General Public
License</a>. Feel free to post it to various other OS/2 archive and mirror
sites. Feel free to make any changes or improvements--but be sure to let me
know about them so I can incorporate them into the xfsttos2 package! <p>To
install xfsttos2, unzip it with the <tt>-d</tt> (or the <tt>/dir</tt> parameter
in PKZip 2.50 and greater) in the root of the drive where XFree86 for OS/2 is
installed. Follow the instructions in <tt>\XFree86\doc\xfstt\README.OS2</tt>
next. There is also an FAQ in that directory which has general information
about xfstt.<p><p align="right"><i>Merry Christmas, <br>Joshua Rodd <br><a
