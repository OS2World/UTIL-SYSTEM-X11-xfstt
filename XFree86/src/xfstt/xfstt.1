NAME
       xfstt - X11 font server for *ttf fonts (OS/2 port)

SYNOPSIS
       xfstt [ [--gslist] --sync] [--port n] [--dir dirname]
             [--unstrap] [--multi] [--once] [--help]
             [--res resolution] [--encoding list] [--mondo]

DESCRIPTION
       Xfstt serves *ttf fonts to one X11 server.  Start xfstt
       then tell X11 about the font server with:

       xset fp+ inet/127.0.0.1:7100

       Set your FONTSERVER environment variable to:

       SET FONTSERVER=127.0.0.1:7100

       You should preferrably embed the above line in CONFIG.SYS.

OPTIONS

       --sync  Synchronize the font database with installed fonts
               and exit when done. Don't do this while xfstt is
               running.

       --gslist
               Print font list in a format usable for ghostscript
               during --sync. Currently the --gslist option has
               to be before the --sync option:

               xfstt --gslist --sync

       --encoding
               Remap to different encodings. Default is
               iso8859-1. Usage example:

               xfstt --encoding iso8859-2,koi8-r,windows-1251

               !!!NOTE: one comma but no blanks between the
               encodings!!!

       --port number
               Change the port number for xfstt's font services.
               The default for X11 font servers is --port 7100.

       --dir name

               Change xfstt's font directory.
               The default is:

               --dir /XFree86/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType

               (/XFree86 is in your X11ROOT directory.)

       --res value
               Force the resolution for underspecified fonts to
               value (typically 96 or 120). Default is the value
               the X11 server suggests which can be adjusted by
               the -dpi option of the X11 server. Standard X11
               servers have defaults of 72 dpi.

       --unstrap
               Allow some more unicode characters. This is
               dangerous for many X11 servers. Start the X server
               with the "-deferglyphs 16" option to give the X
               server a better chance of surviving. For very
               carefully implemented X servers you may recompile
               with UNSTRAPLIMIT set to 65535 in order to get the
               complete unicode range.

       --once  Exit after the font client disconnects.

       --multi Opposite of --once option. This has become the
               default behaviour, so it is obsolete now and is
               ignored for backwards compatibility. It will be
               removed in a future release.

       --inetd Tell xfstt to be used as inetd service.

       --daemon
               Behave like a daemon. Avoid this option under
               OS/2.

       --help  Print brief usage information on standard output
               and exit.

       --mondo Only service one client at a time. Use this option
               if you have problems under OS/2.
