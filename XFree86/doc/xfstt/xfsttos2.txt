       Short Description: xfsttos2 - TrueType X fontserver for OS/2
        Long Description: xfsttos2 - port of xfstt to OS/2
                          Allows you to use TrueType fonts with XFree86
                          for OS/2. It's derived from Herbert Duerr's
                          excellent xfstt, which was intended for Unix.
                          It gives good performance and gives excellent
                          rendering of fonts at low resolutions. You
                          can use your TrueType fonts from Win-OS/2 or
                          any other Windows system. Includes documentation
                          on how to get it to work with IBM's INETD.
                          Includes updates from a contributor which make
                          it easier to set up when just using it with a
                          local X server.
